# Starfield Simulation

This is a Starfield simulation built with Java and Swing. The simulation generates a moving starfield effect, where stars appear to move toward the observer, creating the illusion of a spaceship traveling through space.

## Features
- Dynamic star movement
- Smooth animation
- Customizable speed and star density

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Swing library (comes with Java)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammetcnli/Starfield.git
2. Compile and run StarfieldCanvas.java

## Example

## Usage
- Run the Java application to view the starfield in motion.
- Adjust the parameters to modify the star density and speed.
